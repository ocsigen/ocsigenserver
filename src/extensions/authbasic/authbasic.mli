(** Module [Authbasic]: Basic HTTP Authentication. *)

(** This module implements Basic HTTP Authentication as described in
    {{:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt}RFC 2617}.  It can be used
    to add an authentication layer to sites with no built-in
    authentication (e.g. static files). Beware, passwords are
    transmitted in cleartext with this scheme, so the medium should be
    secured somehow (by e.g. SSL).

    This module implements only the HTTP-related part of the protocol,
    and is meant to be extended with various authentication schemes. A
    very naive one (authentication with a single user/password, given
    in the configuration file) is provided. *)


val register_basic_authentication_method :
  (Simplexmlparser.xml -> string -> string -> bool Lwt.t) -> unit
(** This function registers an authentication plugin: it adds a new
    parser to the list of available authentication schemes.

    A parser takes as argument an XML tree (corresponding to the
    first son of an <authbasic> element in the configuration
    file) and returns an authentication function [f]. [f] will be
    called for each request with the supplied user and password and
    should return (cooperatively) a boolean telling whether access
    is granted or not. Exceptions are handled the same way as for
    extension parsers.

    The <authbasic> element must have a {i realm} attribute,
    giving some identifier to the resource which is protected
    (several resources on the same hostname can share the same
    realm). This gives a general customization scheme "for free"
    from the point of view of plugin developers and is totally
    transparent to the plugin. *)


val get_basic_authentication_method :
  Simplexmlparser.xml -> string -> string -> bool Lwt.t
(** This function combines all the parsers registered with
    [register_basic_authentication_method]. It might be useful for
    other extensions. Not for the casual user. *)
