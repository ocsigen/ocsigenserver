(** Persistent data on hard disk. *)

(**
   There are currently two implementations of this module,
   one using a DBM database, and the other using SQLITE.
   Link the one your want with your program.
*)


(*****************************************************************************)
(** {2 Persistent references} *)
(** When launching the program, if the value exists on hard disk,
    it is loaded, otherwise it is initialised to the default value *)

(** Type of persistent data *)
type 'a t

(** Data are divided into stores.
    Create one store for your project, where you will save all your data. *)
type store

(** Open a store (and create it if it does not exist)  *)
val open_store : string -> store

val make_persistent :
  store:store -> name:string -> default:'a -> 'a t Lwt.t
(** [make_persistent store name default] find a persistent value
    named [name] in store [store]
    from database, or create it with the default value [default] if it
    does not exist. *)

val make_persistent_lazy :
  store:store -> name:string -> default:(unit -> 'a) -> 'a t Lwt.t
(** Same as make_persistent but the default value is evaluated only
    if needed
*)

val make_persistent_lazy_lwt :
  store:store -> name:string -> default:(unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a t Lwt.t
(** Lwt version of make_persistent_lazy.
*)

val get : 'a t -> 'a Lwt.t
(** [get pv] gives the value of [pv] *)

val set : 'a t -> 'a -> unit Lwt.t
(** [set pv value] sets a persistent value [pv] to [value] *)

(*****************************************************************************)
(** {2 Persistent tables} *)

(** Type of persistent table *)
type 'value table

(** returns the name of the table  *)
val table_name : 'value table -> string Lwt.t

(** Open a table (and create it if it does not exist)  *)
val open_table : string -> 'value table

val find : 'value table -> string -> 'value Lwt.t
(** [find table key] gives the value associated to [key].
    Fails with [Not_found] if not found. *)

val add : 'value table -> string -> 'value -> unit Lwt.t
(** [add table key value] associates [value] to [key].
    If the database already contains data associated with [key],
    that data is discarded and silently replaced by the new data.
*)

val replace_if_exists : 'value table -> string -> 'value -> unit Lwt.t
(** [replace_if_exists table key value]
    associates [value] to [key] only if [key] is already bound.
    If the database does not contain any data associated with [key],
    fails with [Not_found].
*)

val remove : 'value table -> string -> unit Lwt.t
(** [remove table key] removes the entry in the table if it exists *)

val length : 'value table -> int Lwt.t
(** Size of a table. *)

val iter_step : (string -> 'a -> unit Lwt.t) -> 'a table -> unit Lwt.t
(** Important warning: this iterator may not iter on all data of the table
    if another thread is modifying it in the same time. Nonetheless, it should
    not miss more than a very few data from time to time, except if the table
    is very old (at least 9 223 372 036 854 775 807 insertions).
*)

val iter_table : (string -> 'a -> unit Lwt.t) -> 'a table -> unit Lwt.t
(** Legacy interface for iter_step *)

val fold_step : (string -> 'a -> 'b -> 'b Lwt.t) ->
  'a table -> 'b -> 'b Lwt.t
(** Important warning: this iterator may not iter on all data of the table
    if another thread is modifying it in the same time. Nonetheless, it should
    not miss more than a very few data from time to time, except if the table
    is very old (at least 9 223 372 036 854 775 807 insertions).
*)

val fold_table : (string -> 'a -> 'b -> 'b Lwt.t) ->
  'a table -> 'b -> 'b Lwt.t
(** Legacy interface for fold_step *)

(**/**)
val iter_block : (string -> 'a -> unit) -> 'a table -> unit Lwt.t
(** MAJOR WARNING: Unlike iter_step, this iterator won't miss any
    entry and will run in one shot. It is therefore more efficient, BUT:
    it will lock the WHOLE database during its execution,
    thus preventing ANYBODY from accessing it (including the function f
    which is iterated).
    As a consequence : you MUST NOT use any function from ocsipersist in f,
    otherwise you would lock yourself and everybody else ! Be VERY cautious.
