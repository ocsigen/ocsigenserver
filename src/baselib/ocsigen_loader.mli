(** Module [Ocsigen_loader]: Dynamic loading for Ocsigen. *)

(** Notes about Findlib usage:
    - Findlib is called with predicates "plugin", "mt". Moreover, the
      predicate "native" or "byte" is added, depending on whether
      Ocsigen is running in native or bytecode mode.
    - In native mode, .cmx/.cmxa extensions provided by META files are
      replaced by .cmxs.
    - The OCAMLPATH environment variable is ignored altogether.

val section : Lwt_log_core.section
(** use Lwt_log.Section.set_level in order to debug *)

val translate : string -> string
(** [translate filename] translate .cmo/.cma extensions to .cmxs in
    native mode, and .cmxs to .cmo (.cma if it exists) in bytecode
    mode. *)

val set_init_on_load : bool -> unit
(** If set to [true], the module initialization functions passed to
    [set_module_init_function] will be executed directly. Otherwise,
    they will have to be invoked using [init_module] at some later stage. *)

val loadfile : (unit -> unit) -> (unit -> unit) -> bool -> string -> unit
(** [loadfile pre post force file] (dynamically) loads [file]. If
    [force] is [false], remember [file] so that it isn't loaded
    twice. If the loading effectively occurs, [pre] (resp. [post])
    is called before (resp. after) the loading. [post] will be
    called even if the loading fails. *)

val loadfiles : (unit -> unit) -> (unit -> unit) -> bool -> string list -> unit
(** [loadfiles pre post force file] loads all the [files], using
    [loadfile (fun () -> ()) (fun () -> ()) false] for all the files
    but the last one, and [loadfile pre post force] for the last one
    (if any). *)

val set_module_init_function :
   [< `Name of string | `Site of site | `Default_site]
  -> (unit -> unit)
  -> unit
(** [set_module_init_function name f] registers the function [f], which will
    be used to initialize the module when [init_module name] is called.
    Will replace the previous value.
  *)

val add_module_init_function :
   [< `Name of string | `Site of site | `Default_site]
  -> (unit -> unit)
  -> unit
(** [add_module_init_function name f] adds [f] to the initialisation functions
    to be run when [init_module name] is called.  *)

val init_module :
   (unit -> unit)
  -> (unit -> unit)
  -> bool
  -> [< `Name of string | `Site of site | `Default_site]
  -> unit
(** [init_module pre post force name] runs the init function for the module
    [name]. If [force] is [false], remember [name] so that the init function
    isn't executed twice. If the function is executed, [pre] (resp. [post])
    is called before (resp. after) the loading. [post] will be
    called even if the loading fails. *)

val get_ocamlpath : unit -> string list
(** Returns the current Findlib library search path. *)

val set_ocamlpath : string list -> unit
(** Sets the current Findlib library search path. The OCaml standard
    library path and some site-specific paths are always implicitly
    added. *)

val add_ocamlpath : string -> unit
(** Adds a path to the Findlib library search path. *)

val findfiles : string -> string list
(** [findfiles pkg] returns the list of files needed to load Findlib
    package [pkg], including dependencies. The archive files of
    [pkg] will appear last in the returned result. *)
