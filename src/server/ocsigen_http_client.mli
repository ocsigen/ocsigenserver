(**
   Do an HTTP request (low level).

   If the optional argument [headers] is present, no headers will be
   added by Ocsigen, but those in this argument and host, and
   [connection: close] or [connection: keep-alive].
   Be carefull to respect HTTP/1.1 in this case!
   ([host] is the full Host HTTP field to send).

   The default port is 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS.

   The default protocol is http ([https=false]).

   The optional parameter [~keep_alive] asks to keep the connection opened
   after the request for a short amount of time
   to allow other requests to the same server to use the same connection.
   It is true by default.
   If there is one opened free connection, we will use it instead of opening
   a new one.

   If you do this request to serve it later to a client or to generate a page
   for a client, add the optional parameter [~client].
   Thus, the request you do will be pipelined
   with other requests coming from the same connection.
   A request will never be pipelined after a request from another client
   connection.
   Pipelining will be used only for requests to server we know supporting it
   (according to previous requests).
   It is recommended to specify this optional parameter for all requests
   (with the value found in field
   [ri_client] of type {!Ocsigen_extensions.request_info}).

   The optional parameter [?head] asks to do a [HEAD] HTTP request.
   It is [false] by default.

   When called without the last parameter, the function will pipeline
   the request (if needed), then return the function to get the page.
   This allows to keep pipeline order when writing an extension.

(** Same as {!Ocsigen_http_client.raw_request},
    but does not try to reuse connections.
    Opens a new connections for each request. Far less efficient.
