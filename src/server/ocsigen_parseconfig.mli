(**/**)

(** [parse_size_tag tag s] parses a size.

    The size can be either "infinity" or use SI or binary units, e.g.,
    10 10B 10o 10ko 10kB 10kiB 10MiB 10TB ... .

    In case of error, raises [Ocsigen_config.Config_file_error m]
    where [m] is an error message explaining that a size was expected
    in tag [<tag>]. *)
val parse_size_tag : string -> string -> int64 option

(** Extracts (and stores via Ocsigen_config) the following information:
    {ul
    {- user to execute OcsigenServer (ex: www-data) }
    {- group to execute OcsigenServer (ex: www-data) }
    {- SSL key, SSL certificate, SSL ciphers list,
       SSL DH file, SSL EC curve }
    {- list of HTTP port to listen on (ex: 80) }
    {- list of HTTPS port to listen on (ex: 443) }
    {- minimum and maximum number of threads }
    }
    To be called early by [Ocsigen_server].
