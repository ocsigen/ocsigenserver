(** Finds [filename] in the filesystem, with a possible redirection
    if it is a directory. Takes into account the fact that [filename]
    does not exists, is a symlink or is a directory, and raises
    Failed_404 or Failed_403 accordingly.

    - we return ["filename/index.html"] if [filename] corresponds to
    a directory, ["filename/index.html"] is valid, and ["index.html"]
    is one possible index (trying all possible indexes in order)
    - we raise [Failed_404] if [filename] corresponds to a directory,
    no index exists and [list_dir_content] is false.
    Warning: this behaviour is not the same as Apache's but it corresponds
    to a missing service in Eliom (answers 404). This also allows to have
    an Eliom service after a "forbidden" directory
    - we raise [Failed_403] if [filename] is a symlink that must
    not be followed
    - raises [Failed_404] if [filename] does not exist, or is a special file
    - otherwise returns [filename]

    [no_check_for] is supposed to be a prefix of [filename] ;
    directories above [no_check_for] are not checked for symlinks *)
