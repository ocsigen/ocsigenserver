  * Eliom: Timeouts for coservices
  * Ocsigen: It is now possible to give parameters to extensions in
    configuration file.
  * Ocsigen: Simplifying parsing of configuration file (could be
    improved).
  * Ocsigen: EXPERIMENTAL It is now possible to reload the modules
    without stopping the server.
  * Staticmod: Rewriting of URLs using regular expressions.

===== 0.6.0 (2007-03-14) =====

  * {{{configure}}} script
  * {{{<select>}}} in forms, by Stéphane Dalmas
  * EXPERIMENTAL: The Web server is now extensible. It means that you
    can add modules (like Apache modules) for generating pages,
    filters of requests, extensions of config files. For now there are
    two modules, one for static pages, and one for dynamic pages. The
    only changes for users is that they need to dynlink staticmod.cmo
    and ocsigenmod.cma from the configuration file. The syntax of
    config file for modules and staticdir also changed.
  * It is now possible to specify the encoding of characters for each
    sub-site.
  * Now usable with Ocamlnet 2.2 or 1.1.2.
  * EXPERIMENTAL: If OCamlDuce is installed on your system, you can
    now use it to do the type-checking of your pages (see the
    documentation). Warning: This is broken with OCamlDuce 3.09.2
    patch level 2. You need at least OCamlDuce 3.09.3 patch level 1.
  * Removing Ocsimore from the default distribution. That version of
    Ocsimore is not supported anymore. Ocsimore has been rewritten
    from scratch by Piero Furiesi.

===== 0.5.1 (2006-12-14) =====

  * Bugfix Konqueror: Multipart forms with now work correctly with
    Konqueror
  * Bugfix Internet Explorer: getting around a bug of Internet
    Explorer while displaying page
  * Bugfix NetBSD: Makefile
  * Bugfix Debian for HPPA, Mips, Alpha: Makefile
  * Bugfix: preemptive.cmi was missing in the installation directory
  * Adding manpage (S. Mimram)
  * Adding logrotate configuration
  * Daemon mode: adding setsid and redirect stdout/stderr to
    /dev/null. Closing stdin.

===== 0.5.0 (2006-11-23) =====

  * HTTP 1.1 improved (HEAD, ETag, keep-alive implemented,
    If-Modified-Since, ...)
  * HTTPS support
  * Pipelining of requests
  * Server can listen on several ports
  * Multiple servers: you can now define several servers in the config
    file.
  * Virtual hosts: filtering on hostnames/ports (with wildcards)
  * Asynchronous file upload with multipart support
  * Large file transfer improved.
  * MIME types are now parsed from a file
  * Changes in the syntax of config file
  * Accessors for server parameters. Use ({{{get_user_agent sp}}})
    instead of {{{sp.user_agent}}}.
  * Page generation is now using {{{Lwt}}} cooperative threads, to
    make it possible the generation of several pages at the same
    time. Practically, add {{{Lwt.return}}} before the page you want
    to send, and use cooperative input/output functions.
  * Typing errors of parameters are now catchable.
  * {{{static_dir}}} is now a function
  * Most of global references have been removed. You now need to give
    sp as parameter to {{{register_for_session}}}, {{{static_dir}}},
    {{{close_session}}}, etc.
  * Links and forms now take {{{server_params}}} instead of
    {{{current_url}}} ({{{sp}}} is shorter than {{{sp.current_url}}})
  * EXPERIMENTAL: Use of preemptive threads for non cooperative
    libraries ({{{detach}}} function).
  * EXPERIMENTAL: The {{{Ocsigen}}} module now contains a functor
    {{{Make}}} to allows the use of several ways of generating
    XHTML. The default way (using {{{XHTML.M}}} or the syntax
    extension) can be used by doing {{{open Ocsigen.Xhtml}}}. There is
    also an untyped xhtml generation module called {{{Ocsigen.Text}}}.
  * EXPERIMENTAL: extension of forms.
  * Reorganisation of the code
  * Bugfixes in makefiles
  * Bugfix: escaping of strings in xhtml with syntax extension (thanks
    to David Mentre)

===== 0.4.0 (2006-06-06) =====

  * Full reimplementation of the core using Generalized Algebraic Data
    Types,
  * {{{_int}}}, {{{_string}}}, etc. are now called {{{int}}},
    {{{string}}}, etc.
  * The type {{{_http_params}}} is now called {{{server_params}}},
  * Services functions now all take 3 parameters, one for server
    parameters, one for GET parameters, and one for POST
    parameters. Note that {{{**}}} is used to create **pairs** and not
    tuples.
  * The {{{a}}} and {{{post_form}}} functions now take a fix number of
    parameters, corresponding to GET parameters.
  * //URLs// are now called //services//,
  * //state URLs// are now called //auxiliary services//,
  * {{{register_post_url}}} does not exist anymore. use
    {{{register_service}}} instead (idem for all other
    {{{register_post_*}}} functions).
  * Changes for prefix URLs
  * Small changes for actions
  * EXPERIMENTAL: sums, bool and list types for services and forms
  * small bugfixes
